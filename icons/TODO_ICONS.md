# TODO: Create Extension Icons

**Status**: Icons not yet created
**Priority**: HIGH - Required for Chrome Web Store submission
**Blocker**: Yes - Extension cannot be submitted without icons

## Quick Action Required

You need to create three icon files before the extension can be submitted:

1. **icons/icon-16.png** - 16x16 pixels
2. **icons/icon-48.png** - 48x48 pixels
3. **icons/icon-128.png** - 128x128 pixels

## Fastest Solution: Use AI or Online Tool

### Option 1: Quick Placeholder (5 minutes)

Use an online icon generator:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Upload any image (logo, guitar pic, etc.)
- Download generated icons
- Rename to icon-16.png, icon-48.png, icon-128.png

### Option 2: Create Simple Icon (15 minutes)

1. Open Canva or Figma (free)
2. Create 128x128px canvas
3. Add blue background (#0066CC)
4. Add white ₪ symbol or guitar icon
5. Export as PNG
6. Resize to 48x48 and 16x16

### Option 3: Use AI (10 minutes)

Prompt for ChatGPT/DALL-E/Midjourney:
```
Create a simple, modern icon for a Chrome extension that calculates
Israeli customs fees for Thomann.de purchases. Include a guitar
silhouette and ₪ (shekel) symbol. Blue and white colors. Flat design.
Square format, 128x128 pixels.
```

Then export at 128x128, 48x48, and 16x16.

## After Creating Icons

1. Place files in `icons/` directory:
   ```
   icons/
   ├── icon-16.png
   ├── icon-48.png
   └── icon-128.png
   ```

2. Rebuild extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Test in Chrome:
   ```bash
   # Load unpacked extension from dist/ folder
   # Check that icons appear correctly in toolbar and extensions page
   ```

4. Verify icons are in dist/ after build:
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/icons/
   ```

## Icon Design Tips

**Keep it simple!**
- The 16x16 version must be recognizable
- Use high contrast colors
- Avoid fine details or text
- Test at actual size before finalizing

**Suggested designs:**
- 🎸 Guitar + ₪ symbol
- 📦 Package + flag colors
- 💰 Calculator + music note
- 🏷️ Price tag + guitar

## Current Status

- ✅ manifest.json updated with icon paths
- ✅ icons/ directory created
- ✅ Comprehensive README with instructions
- ❌ **Actual icon files NOT created yet**

## Next Steps

1. **YOU**: Create the three icon files
2. Run `npm run build` to include icons in dist/
3. Test extension loading in Chrome
4. If icons look good, proceed to screenshots
5. If not, iterate on design
