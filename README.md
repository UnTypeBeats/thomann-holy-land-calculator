# Holy Land Fee Calculator

A Chrome extension that calculates the true landed cost of products from Thomann.de for Israeli customers, including shipping, customs, and VAT fees.

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ Working MVP** - Order Summary Feature (Oct 2025)
- Runs on Thomann checkout pages
- Uses **real shipping costs** from actual orders
- Displays Israeli prices (‚Ç™) with full fee breakdown
- Successfully tested with multi-item orders

## Why This Extension?

Israeli musicians face **48-71% markup** (median 61%) on top of Thomann prices due to:
- Shipping costs (‚Ç¨50-‚Ç¨470)
- Customs duties (0-12%, varies by product)
- Israeli VAT (18%)
- Exchange rate fluctuations

This extension provides transparent, real-time pricing to avoid checkout surprises.

## Features

### Order Summary Calculator (New!)
- **Real shipping costs**: Uses actual Thomann shipping prices from your order
- **Per-item breakdown**: See the true cost for each item
- **Accurate calculations**: 10-20% variance (vs 40-50% with estimates)
- **Automatic expansion**: Shows all items without manual clicking

### Product Page Calculator (Legacy)
- Quick estimates on product pages
- Basic fee calculations using historical averages
- Less accurate but instant feedback
