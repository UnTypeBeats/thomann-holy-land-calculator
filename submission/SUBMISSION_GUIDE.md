## Troubleshooting Common Submission Issues

### Issue: "Manifest validation failed"
**Cause**: Syntax error in `manifest.json`
**Fix**: Validate JSON at jsonlint.com, check required fields

### Issue: "Icon could not be loaded"
**Cause**: Icon files missing or wrong path
**Fix**: Verify `icons/icon-16.png` etc. exist in ZIP root, check paths in manifest

### Issue: "Privacy policy required"
**Cause**: Extension requests permissions but no policy provided
**Fix**: Add privacy policy URL or paste policy text in field

### Issue: "Single purpose unclear"
**Cause**: Description too vague or mentions multiple unrelated features
**Fix**: Focus description on core purpose (Thomann fee calculation), explain how features support this

### Issue: "Permissions overly broad"
**Cause**: Requesting more permissions than needed
**Fix**: Review `manifest.json`, remove unused permissions, justify each in submission form

### Issue: "Deceptive installation tactics"
**Cause**: Description or screenshots misleading
**Fix**: Ensure screenshots show real functionality, description matches actual behavior

### Issue: "User data policy violation"
**Cause**: Collecting data without disclosure or consent
**Fix**: Update privacy policy, add user consent UI if collecting data (or don't collect data!)
